<h1>Salary Payment</h1>
<p> Application to calculate the salary based in the worked day
</p><br>

<h2>WARNING!</h2>

<p>Is used to calculate based in brazilian salary</p>
<br>

<h2>How it works?</h2>

<p>A employee should works 24 days in this month <br>
Your salary should be R$1500,00 but him/her worked <br>
only 20 and 3 days is justified absences, then we have <br>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><b>Salary</b>: 1500.00</li>
<li><b>Days to Work</b>: 24</li>
<li><b>Worked Days</b>: 20</li>
<li><b>Justified Absences</b>: 3</li>
</ul>
<br>

<b>Calculate</b>:<br>
1500 / 24 = 62.50 (This is value per day)<br>
20 * 62.50 = 1250<br>
3 * 62.50 = 187.50<br>
Salary = 1437.50<br>
<br><br>

now we must reduce the value that a brazilian pay to INSS (7.5% to 14% of salary)<br>

1437.50 - 9% = 1340.87<br>

<b>Value to Pay</b>: R$1340.87<br>
